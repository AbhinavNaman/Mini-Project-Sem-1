        In this method, we convert sewage waste waters potential energy to kinetic energy to use it to rotate the shafts of the micro turbines in order to produce electricity.
ustralia’s North Head Sewage Treatment Plant started up a 4.5-MW small hydro unit that harvests power from treated wastewater falling down a 60-meter shaft. The sewage plant, located on the North Head Peninsula at the entrance to Sydney Harbour, near Manly, serves a population of over one million people and treats about 300 million liters of flow a day. Treated effluent is discharged through a Deepwater Ocean outfall.

        Sydney Water is pioneering the plant in Australia, but it isn’t the first in the world to harness hydroelectricity from a wastewater plant. The system relieves excess water pressure delivered to customers at elevations lower than the water source. The inherent pressure differentials are used to spin turbines to create power.
Most recently, a 225-kW system is being developed at a Los Angeles wastewater treatment plant. 19% of electricity produced in California is allocated toward treating and distributing water and wastewater. Another 30-kW system is being designed for a municipal water agency near Pittsburgh, and Rentricity is gearing up to start construction on an energy recovery installation within the Water Treatment Facility for the City of Keene

Meanwhile, in a concept that is closer to the Australian plant, Washington State–based Hydrovolts has devised an “in-stream” hydrokinetic turbine for sewer and wastewater systems. That company’s “Flipwing” turbine uses a cross-axis design so that power can be harnessed even from water that is not clean. Hydrovolts, which says that three wastewater treatment plants in Washington, New York, and Oregon have inquired about the turbines, claims that the potential for small and micro hydropower at wastewater treatment plants is tremendous. The company points out that in the U.S. alone, there are some 16,583 wastewater treatment plants.
